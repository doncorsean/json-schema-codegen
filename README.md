## SBT Plugin  

You can run the scala code generator as part of your build.

By default the schema definitions should be placed in src/main/json-schema.

In project/plugins.sbt add:

```scala

resolvers ++= Seq(
  Resolver.url("vox-public-ivy", url("http://dl.bintray.com/content/voxsupplychain/ivy-public"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
)

addSbtPlugin("com.voxsupplychain" %% "json-schema-codegen-sbt" % "0.3.0")

```

In build.sbt :

```scala
  // json-schema to be watched for changes in ~compile
  watchSources <++= baseDirectory map { dir =>
    Seq(
      dir / "src/main/json-schema"
    )
  }
```

Code is generated during the compile phase.
